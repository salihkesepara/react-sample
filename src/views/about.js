      Age of Empires is a series of historical real-time strategy video games,
      originally developed by Ensemble Studios and published by Xbox Game Studios.
      The first game was Age of Empires, released in 1997. Nine total games within
      the series have been released so far as of 28 October 2021.

      Age of Empires focused on events in Europe, Africa and Asia, spanning from the
      Stone Age to the Iron Age; the expansion game explored the formation and
      expansion of the Roman Empire. The sequel, Age of Empires II: The Age of
      Kings, was set in the Middle Ages, while its expansion focused partially
      on the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. The subsequent three games
      of Age of Empires III explored the early modern period, when Europe was
      colonizing the Americas and several Asian nations were on the decline.
      Another installment, Age of Empires Online, takes a different approach
      as a free-to-play online game utilizing Games for Windows Live. A spin-off
      game, Age of Mythology, was set in the same period as the original Age of
      Empires, but focused on mythological elements of Greek, Egyptian, and Norse
      mythology. The fourth main installment in the series, Age of Empires IV, was
      released on October 28, 2021.[1][2]Age of Empires is a series of historical real-time strategy video games,
